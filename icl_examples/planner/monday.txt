Example 1:

User query: Get the total duration of my tasks in monday for the board AgileLoop
Plan step 1: Get the id of the board with name AgileLoop
API response: POST /v2 with the graphql query = query {
  boards{
    id
    name
  }
} to get all the boards
Plan step 2: Continue. Extract the board id for the board with name "AgileLoop".
API response: The board id of the product "AgileLoop" is "6842334624"
Plan step 3: Get the tasks durations in monday for the board with id 6842334624
API response: POST /v2 with the graphql query = "query {
  boards (ids: 6842334624){
    items_page (limit: 10) {
      cursor
      items {
         column_values {
          ... on TimeTrackingValue {
            durationInSeconds:duration
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}" to get all the tasks duration of the board with id 6842334624
Thought: I have successfully executed the POST request to get the tasks with the time durations, the response contains the duration of each tasks and I will return the sum of all.
Final Answer: The total duration of your tasks in monday is 7200seconds which is 2 hours.
