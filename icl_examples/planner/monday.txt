Example 1:

User query: Get the total duration of my tasks in monday for the board AgileLoop
Plan step 1: Get the id of the board with name AgileLoop
API response: POST /v2 with the graphql query = query {
  boards{
    id
    name
  }
} to get all the boards
Plan step 2: Continue. Extract the board id for the board with name "AgileLoop".
API response: The board id of the product "AgileLoop" is "6842334624"
Plan step 3: Get the tasks durations in monday for the board with id 6842334624
API response: POST /v2 with the graphql query = "query {
  boards (ids: 6842334624){
    allItems:items_page (limit: 10) {
      cursor
      items {
        id
        name
         itemData:column_values {
          column{
            title
          }
          text
        }
      }
    }
  }
}" to get all the tasks information of the board with id 6842334624
Plan Step 4: I have all the tasks information, now I will look for the text of column with title "Timeline" and use these timelines to calculate the tasks durations
Thought: I have successfully executed the POST request to get the tasks with their information and have aggregate succesfully the timelines to return the tasks durations.
Final Answer: The total duration of your tasks in monday is 6 days.
